# Make-My-Mood

Start with the index.html file â€” it's the central hub that links to all mood-specific pages.

Each mood (like happy, sad, stressed, angry, etc.) has its own unique HTML page.

A separate Login page is also included if you'd like to add user access or personalization in the future.
